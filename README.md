# Godot Languages Support
> Originally forked from https://gist.github.com/ShalokShalom/7b2308e6ddc020d7ab7080b645953f1b

*A community-maintained listing of languages with bindings for Godot Engine.*

## Categories

### (TODO)
(Per-module support feature legend. Currently, Rust (IIRC) doesn't support the video encoding module.)

### By feature
- 游늺 Editor support available

### By maintainer
- 游눐 Official
- 游논 Community-maintained


## 游끥 Full support
1. **[GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/index.html) 游눐游늺**

  GDScript is actively maintained and documented, and is stable. 

It is the primary language, has the most tutorials online and has deep in-Godot editor support.

## 游볞 Production Ready
1. **[Rust](https://github.com/godot-rust/godot-rust) 游논**
1. **[Nim](https://github.com/pragmagic/godot-nim) 游논**
1. **[JavaScript](https://github.com/GodotExplorer/ECMAScript) 游논**
1. **[C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/index.html) 游눐**

  These languages are documented and stable. Some people use it in production.

  (C# External Code Editing support is decent. What's it like for the others?)

## 游볟 Nearly There
1. **[D](https://github.com/godot-d/godot-d) 游논**

  Stable, not documented.

## 游볠 Has Potential
1. **[Python](https://github.com/touilleMan/godot-python) 游논游늺**  
1. **[Kotlin](https://github.com/utopia-rise/godot-kotlin)** 游논

  Python is the only language integrated via PluginScript. It provides editor integration as GDScript does - it's still in beta.

  Kotlin bindings, while declared unready for production use and still in alpha, are being maintained fairly regularly in 2020.

## 游끤 Okay, I guess?
1. **[C++](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp) 游눐**

  C++ is a bit of a hot potato anywhere, and it is here as well: some people like to use it, but it could use better documention and can be difficult to set up (requires SCons for building, must use git submodules).

  It's used for writing modules and plugins via GDNative.

## Left 4 Dead
1. **[Haskell](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/godot-haskell) 游논**
1. **[Go](https://github.com/ShadowApex/godot-go)游논**

  Haskell is used by one project only and is only partly integrated and documented.
  
  Go bindings haven't been updated since 2018.

  Sadly, not documented and stable enough for production.
  If you can, please revive them.
